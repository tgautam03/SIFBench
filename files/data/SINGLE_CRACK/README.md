# Single Crack Dataset
In the single-crack datasets, each component contains one crack. These datasets were generated using high-fidelity FEM simulations, and span three distinct geometry types: 

1. **Surface crack in a plate:** Contained in the folder ***SURFACE_CRACK***.
2. **Corner crack at a straight hole:** Contained in the folder ***CORNER_CRACK_STRAIGHT_HOLE***.
3. **Corner crack at a countersunk hole:** Contained in the folder ***CORNER_CRACK_COUNTERSUNK_HOLE***.

Training and testing dataset are split and put into separate csv files inside each folder.
