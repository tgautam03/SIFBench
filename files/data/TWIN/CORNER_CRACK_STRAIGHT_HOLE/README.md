# Twin Corner Cracks at a Straight Hole
This dataset involves two corner cracks originating at either side of a straight shank-hole in a plate. Three distinct loading conditions were considered independently: tension ($K-T$), bending ($K-B$), and bearing/pin ($K-P$) loading. FEM simulation results were obtained from the Center for Aircraft Structural Life Extension (CAStLE) at the U.S. Air Force Academy. The meshes were specifically designed for the hp-version of the finite element method, allowing high accuracy in stress field resolution. There are two crack configurations:

1. **Quarter-Elliptical Corner Crack:** This dataset is in the files named ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_BH_QUARTER_ELLIPSE_TRAIN.csv*** and ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_BH_QUARTER_ELLIPSE_TEST.csv***. The two ends of both of the crack fronts are at the front of the plate and at the hole, forming a quarter-elliptical shape. The dataset comprises 70,000 simulations (train + test), each represented by the ratio of plate width to hole radius ($W/r$), the aspect ratios of the two cracks ($a_1/c_1$ and $a_2/c_2$), the relative crack depths ($a_1/t$ and $a_2/t$), and the ratio of hole radius to plate thickness ($r/t$). SIF values ($K1-T$, $K2-T$, $K1-B$, $K2-B$, $K1-P$, and $K2-P$) are recorded along both crack fronts and are parameterized by the angles $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, each sampled at a resolution of 0.024 radians.

2. **Through-Thickness Corner Crack:** This dataset is in the file named ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_BH_THROUGH_THICKNESS_TRAIN.csv*** and ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_BH_THROUGH_THICKNESS_TEST.csv***. The two ends of the crack front are at the front and the back of the plate. The dataset includes 3,055 distinct simulations (train + test), with geometries characterized by the same parameters: $W/r$, $a_1/c_1$, $a_1/t$, $a_2/c_2$, $a_2/t$, and $r/t$. As before, SIF values ($K1-T$, $K2-T$, $K1-B$, $K2-B$, $K1-P$, and $K2-P$) are evaluated along the crack fronts using the parametric angles $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, with a resolution of 0.024 radians.
