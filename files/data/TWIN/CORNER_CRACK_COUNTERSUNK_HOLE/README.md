# Twin Corner Cracks at a Countersunk Hole
This dataset involves two corner cracks originating at each side of a countersunk hole in a plate. FEM results were obtained from the Center for Aircraft Structural Life Extension (CAStLE) at the U.S. Air Force Academy, using hp-version finite element meshes tailored for high accuracy. Tension, bending, and bearing/pin loading conditions were applied independently which resulted in three distanct SIF scenarios ($K-T$, $K-B$, and $K-P$) based on the loading condition. The datasets contain a single type of countersunk hole, defined by a slant start depth. This depth is captured by the non-dimensional parameter $b/t$, where $b$ is the vertical distance from the front of the plate to the start of the countersink, and $t$ is the total thickness of the plate.

1. **Quarter-Elliptical Corner Crack:** In this configuration, the two ends of both of the crack fronts are at the front of the plate and at the cylindrical section of the hole, forming a quarter-elliptical shape. The finite element models generate 1,091,419 unique plate and crack geometries (train + test) for $b/t = $0.5$. Dataset for $b/t = $0.5$ are stored in files named ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_CS2_QUARTER_ELLIPSE_PART_1_$TRAIN/TEST$.csv***, ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_CS2_QUARTER_ELLIPSE_PART_2_$TRAIN/TEST$.csv***, ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_CS2_QUARTER_ELLIPSE_PART_3_$TRAIN/TEST$.csv***, ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_CS2_QUARTER_ELLIPSE_PART_4_$TRAIN/TEST$.csv***, ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_CS2_QUARTER_ELLIPSE_PART_5_$TRAIN/TEST$.csv***, and ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_CS2_QUARTER_ELLIPSE_PART_6_$TRAIN/TEST$.csv***. Each geometry is described by $W/r$, $a_1/c_1$, $a_1/t$, $a_2/c_2$, $a_2/t$, and $r/t$, with SIF values ($K1-T$, $K2-T$, $K1-B$, $K2-B$, $K1-P$, and $K2-P$) reported along the two crack fronts using $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ as the parametric angles (again sampled at 0.024 radians).

2. **Through-Thickness Corner Crack:** In this configuration, the two ends of both of the crack fronts are at the front of the plate and the countersink or the back of the plate. The finite element models generate 2,720 distinct plate and crack geometries (train + test) for $b/t = 0.5$. Dataset for $b/t = $0.5$, are stored in files named ***TWIN_CORNER_CRACK_CS2_THROUGH_THICKNESS_$TRAIN/TEST$.csv***. Each case is described using the same set of geometric features—$W/r$, $a_1/c_1$, $a_1/t$, $a_2/c_2$, $a_2/t$, and $r/t$—and SIF values ($K1-T$, $K2-T$, $K1-B$, $K2-B$, $K1-P$, and $K2-P$) parameterized along the crack fronts using angles $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ with a resolution of 0.024 radians.
