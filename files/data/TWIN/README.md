# Twin Cracks Dataset
In the twin cracks datasets, twin-crack datasets, in which each instance includes a pair of cracks. These datasets were generated using high-fidelity FEM simulations, and span two distinct geometry types  (with two crack configurations considered for each type): 

1. **Twin corner cracks at a straight hole:** Contained in the folder ***CORNER_CRACK_STRAIGHT_HOLE***.
2. **Twin corner cracks at a countersunk hole:** Contained in the folder ***CORNER_CRACK_COUNTERSUNK_HOLE***.

Training and testing dataset are split and put into separate csv files inside each folder.
